# todo-sails
### A Restful todo api written with sails js.

Supports all the rest verbs alongwith filtering, pagination and sorting.

I have changed the default adapter to sails-memory(but you can change it back to sails-disk or whatever you feel like), since the intention behind writing this was to have a ready to use api, which i can hook-up with my front-end code.
